# Properties file to define the topology of the test cluster
# This is useful to declare the nodes that are on the same rack (in our case room),
# and for nodes that are on another data center.
#
# The format of the entries is:
#
# Node IP=Data Center:Rack
# 192.168.1.1=DC1:RAC1
# 192.168.1.2=DC2:RAC2
#
# The default for all unknown nodes is:
# default=DC1:r1
#
# Native IPv6 is supported, however you must escape the colon in the IPv6 Address
# Also be sure to comment out JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
# in cassandra-env.sh
# fe80\:0\:0\:0\:202\:b3ff\:fe1e\:8329=DC1:RAC3
