<b>MyEurope</b> is a social network which is based on the meta-social network <b><em>myMed</em></b>. It is available for City Halls, institutions or economic realities (industrial, tourism industry...) of the French South-East areas (PACA, Rhone-Alpes) and the three Italian North-Western Regions (Liguria, Piemonte, Valle d'Aosta), i.e. the areas eligible to the Alcotra Program.</p>
<p>This application will help the City Hall of the Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion to find partners, among those who joined the social network, in order to create projects together, within European Programs.</p>
<p>The main targets of <b><em>myEurope</em></b> are:</p>
<ul style='text-align:left'>
    <li>Help, through the mechanism of myMed's "matchmaking", to gather ideas and resources for European project submission or obtain European funds.</li>
    <li>Exchange practices and common cross-border interests in the area of European project creation.</li>
    <li>Inform users about different European calls.</li>
</ul>
